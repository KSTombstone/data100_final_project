                    While it goes without saying that people with diabilities are going to have more dificulty voting due to their disabilities. 
                    The graphic above shows that there is still a large majority of people with disabilities who are still having a hard time voting because of their diabilities.
                    This can be due to the lack of accesibility for people with cognitive, and visual disabilities. This can also be due to the fact that some states have 
                    laws in place that can and will exclude people with disabilities from voting.
