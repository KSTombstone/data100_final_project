            <h2>Why is This Important to People Without Disabilities</h2>
            <section>
                <!--Insert age Iframe Here-->
                <p>
                    This issue concerns people without disabilities because as the graph above shows that people 65+ have a higher turnout percent then any other age group.
                    This can be attributed to the fact that 24% of Americans 65-74 years old have a disability, and 46% of American 75+ years old have a disability. 
                    It is important to understand that a majority of people with disability gained them due to old age, rather then being born with them or gaining them due to 
                    an accident. So by investing in the ability for people with disabilities to have an easier time voting you are also investing in your likelihood that you will 
                    have a easier time voting.
